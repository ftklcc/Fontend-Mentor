      <h3>Instructions</h3>
      <ol>
        <li><span>Beat the eggs</span>: In a bowl, beat the eggs with a pinch of salt and pepper until they are well
          mixed.
          You can add a tablespoon of water or milk for a fluffier texture.</li>
        <li><span>Heat the pan</span>: Place a non-stick frying pan over medium heat and add butter or oil.</li>
        <li><span>Cook the omelette</span>: Once the butter is melted and bubbling, pour in the eggs. Tilt the pan to
          ensure
          the eggs evenly coat the surface.</li>

        <li><span>Heat the pan</span>: When the eggs begin to set at the edges but are still slightly runny in the
          middle, sprinkle your chosen fillings over one half of the omelette.</li>

        <li><span>Add fillings (optional)</span>: In a bowl, beat the eggs with a pinch of salt and pepper until they
          are
          well mixed.
          You can add a tablespoon of water or milk for a fluffier texture.</li>
        <li><span>Fold and serve</span>: As the omelette continues to cook, carefully lift one edge and fold it over the
          fillings. Let it cook for another minute, then slide it onto a plate.</li>
        <li><span>
            Enjoy</span>: Serve hot, with additional salt and pepper if needed.</li>
